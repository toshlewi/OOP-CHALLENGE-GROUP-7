# 📝 Digital Pet Simulator - Python OOP Project

A virtual pet simulator created using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Care for your digital pet by feeding, playing, and teaching it tricks!

## 🐾 Features

- **Core Pet Functionality**:
  - Feed your pet with `eat()` to reduce hunger
  - Let your pet `sleep()` to restore energy
  - `play()` to increase happiness (but consumes energy)
  - Check status with visual indicators

- **Bonus Features**:
  - Teach your pet new tricks with `train()`
  - View all learned tricks with `show_tricks()`
  - Interactive command-line interface
